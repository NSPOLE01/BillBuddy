# Post-Deployment Configuration Checklist

After deploying your backend to Elastic Beanstalk, follow these steps to complete the setup.

## Step 1: Get Your Backend URL

After deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, run:
```bash
eb status
```

Look for the line that says:
```
CNAME: billbuddy-backend-prod.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

Your backend URL will be: `http://billbuddy-backend-prod.eba-p7im42mz.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com`

---

## Step 2: Update Elastic Beanstalk Environment Variables

Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to allow your frontend domain:

```bash
# For localhost testing (before deploying frontend):
eb setenv ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000"

# After deploying frontend (replace with your actual Vercel URL):
eb setenv ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173"
```

Make sure you've also set these variables (you should have done this during initial deployment):
```bash
eb setenv AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key \
  RECEIPTS_TABLE_NAME=BillBuddyReceipts \
  PORT=8080
```

---

## Step 3: Update Frontend Environment Variables

**File**: `/Users/nikhilpolepalli/BillBuddy/frontend/.env.production`

Update this file (already created with template):
```env
# Backend API URL - UPDATE THIS
VITE_API_URL=http://billbuddy-backend-prod.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

# AWS Cognito Configuration (already set correctly)
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_9PI7HTvhL
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=5sf5idq7pbta7q0h0utc1vomr3
VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN=us-east-19pi7htvhl.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com

# OAuth Redirect URLs - UPDATE AFTER DEPLOYING FRONTEND
VITE_REDIRECT_SIGN_IN=https://your-app.vercel.app
VITE_REDIRECT_SIGN_OUT=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**YOU ONLY NEED TO UPDATE**:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Replace with your actual EB URL
- `VITE_REDIRECT_SIGN_IN` and `VITE_REDIRECT_SIGN_OUT` - Update after deploying frontend

---

## Step 4: Test Backend Locally with New URL

Before deploying frontend, test that the backend is accessible:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://billbuddy-backend-prod.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

---

## Step 5: Rebuild and Deploy Backend (if CORS was updated)

Since we updated the CORS configuration, rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilpolepalli/BillBuddy/backend
npm run build
eb deploy
```

Wait for deployment to complete.

---

## Step 6: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilpolepalli/BillBuddy/frontend

# Make sure .env.production is updated with your backend URL
cat .env.production

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://billbuddy-abc123.vercel.app`

---

## Step 7: Update CORS with Frontend URL

Now that you have your frontend URL, update the backend CORS:

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilpolepalli/BillBuddy/backend

# Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS with your Vercel URL
eb setenv ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://billbuddy-abc123.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173"
```

---

## Step 8: Update AWS Cognito Callback URLs

1. Go to [AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito)
2. Select your User Pool
3. Go to **App integration** tab
4. Click on your app client name
5. Scroll to **Hosted UI settings**
6. Update **Allowed callback URLs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```
7. Update **Allowed sign-out URLs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```
8. Click **Save changes**

---

## Step 9: Verify Everything Works

### Test Frontend â†’ Backend Connection

1. Open your Vercel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Network tab
3. Try to sign up or log in
4. Check that API calls are going to your backend URL
5. Verify no CORS errors in console

### Test Complete Flow

- [ ] Sign up with new account
- [ ] Verify email
- [ ] Log in
- [ ] Upload a receipt
- [ ] View receipt results
- [ ] Create a group
- [ ] Split bill
- [ ] View final tab
- [ ] Check spending patterns page
- [ ] Verify charts display
- [ ] Test pagination
- [ ] Delete a receipt

## Step 10: Enable HTTPS (Recommended)

For production, you should use HTTPS for your backend:

1. **Get SSL Certificate**:
   - Go to AWS Certificate Manager
   - Request a public certificate
   - Add your domain (or use Elastic Beanstalk subdomain)

2. **Configure Load Balancer**:
   ```bash
   eb console
   ```
   - Go to Configuration â†’ Load Balancer
   - Add HTTPS listener
   - Select your SSL certificate

3. **Update Frontend .env.production**:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://billbuddy-backend-prod.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
   ```

4. **Redeploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nikhilpolepalli/BillBuddy/frontend
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Environment Variables Set:
1. âœ… Elastic Beanstalk: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
**Error**: "Access to fetch at 'http://...' from origin 'https://...' has been blocked by CORS"

**Solution**:
1. Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable includes your frontend URL
2. Rebuild and redeploy backend: `npm run build && eb deploy`
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Backend Not Responding
**Error**: Network timeout or 504 error

**Solution**:
1. Check backend logs: `eb logs`
2. Verify environment variables: `eb printenv`
3. Check Elastic Beanstalk health: `eb health`

### Authentication Not Working
**Error**: Redirect loop or "Invalid redirect URI"

**Solution**:
1. Verify Cognito callback URLs match your frontend URL exactly
2. Make sure frontend `.env.production` has correct User Pool ID and Client ID
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
